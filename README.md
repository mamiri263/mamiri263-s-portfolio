# Introduction and info:

This website is made for me to preview all my projects in the future and it has some stuff about me too!
- the domain hosting I used is cloudflare and my web hosting is firebase.
- gatsby.js was used to make this website.
- this project is open source so you can use any code that I have used in this project.
